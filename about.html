        <h1>About LinkBoard</h1>
        <p>LinkBoard was created to simplify the way we interact with the web. In an era of "tab overload," having a centralized, local, and visual home base is essential for focus.</p>
        <h2>Technical Architecture</h2>
        <p>This application is built using pure JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. It utilizes the browser's <code>localStorage</code> API for persistence and <code>Blob</code> objects for generating data backups. Because there is no backend database, the tool is incredibly fast and respects user privacy by design.</p>
        <h2>Development Philosophy</h2>
        <p>Our goal was to create a "zero-latency" tool. By avoiding heavy frameworks, LinkBoard loads instantly and works offline once the initial assets are cached.</p>
